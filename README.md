This is an attempt at writing a Rust based communication library that serves as
the link between design tools and the actual label printers. There are a lot of
vendors for label printers out there and nobody there ever decided on any
standard. Some companies even going so far to reinvent the wheel with any
device that supports something new. This situation only got worse in recent
years with cheap Chinese label printers flooding the market.

This library is an attempt to find a way through that, allowing tool designers
to focus on what's important for them: The designing part - leaving the
hardware and compatibility details to this lib.

## Philosophy

As mentioned above: This library's only purpose is to abstract
away the hardware part from the design part. The interface is kept as simple as
possible and only entails selecting devices, sending an image for printing and
getting back relevant status information. It does not - and never will -
support drawing primitives as it goes against the base idea of:
